# ChatGPT-Navigator
Chrome extension to add hotkeys to the ChatGPT interface to expand navigation functionality

## Feature List

### Next/Previous Message
Tired of scrolling? Use Ctrl + Up and Ctrl + Down to focus the next or previous message, skipping past the bulky replies from ChatGPT.


## Future Features

### String Bookmarks
Highlight a string of text and save it for later without losing your place on the page or directly queueing it up in the reply. Supports a configurable hotkey to easily append to existing bookmarks (Default: HOTKEY_TBD).

### Scratch Pad
Collapsible side bar to track bookmarks and write general notes for followup. Use HOTKEY_TBD to open/close it.

### Bookmark Quick Jump
Immediately jumps to the saved string, even if it's buried in the chat history.

### Session Persistence
Persists bookmarks between sessions and links to their respective chat sessions. Stored in browser storage, supports full browser reload.

### Configurable Hotkeys
Set custom hotkeys for all aforementioned functionality (assuming no overlap with browser built-ins).

### Markdown/Code Display Improvement
Cleans up code/markdown display issues, often triggered by "code-toggling" (ie. code block, plain text, code block, plain text). Additional cross-browser testing for consistency.

### Interface Themes and Color Schemes
Customize display appearance with borders, themes, and accents to spice up lengthy sessions.
